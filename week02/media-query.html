            <h2>2 Nephi 2:25</h2>
            <p>
                "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. And the Messiah cometh in the fullness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of
                the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given unto the children of men."

            <h2>D&C 121:7-8</h2>
            <p>
                "And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee, if thou be cast into the deep, or into the hands of robbers, and the sentence of death shall come upon thee, if thou be
                beheaded by the sword, and the life of thy body be lost, but thy soul shall be redeemed, and the resurrection shall come. And if thou shouldst be delivered up to the judgment of God, and be found spotless before him, thou shalt have no more pain."
